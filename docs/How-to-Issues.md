# How to Issues

This file outlines how to report issues properly.

## Tips

Issues should include relevant details such as Run Context. Next, include the version you're using and whether you copy and pasted it or used wally. Include the package, the function and the snippet of code where you're receiving the error as well as the error message word for word. At this point in time, if you are using these libraries with lune, please expect some functions not to work.
