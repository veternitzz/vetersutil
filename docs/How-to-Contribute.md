## Contributing - The tools we use

Before contributing to vetersutil, consider famaliarizing yourself with these tools:

## Contributing - Filesystem

The filesystem is relatively simple to follow. All utilities are located in ``/root/packages/`` and in their own designated folder. Inside of those folders will be an ``init.luau`` file and a wally.toml file. It may include a ``INFO.md`` file which might explain package-specific things.
